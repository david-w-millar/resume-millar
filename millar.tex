        As the resident DevOps evangelist, I helped the hosting team write Puppet manifests to automate infrastructure deployments, used Vagrant, Veewee, Virtualbox, and Puppet to provide portable development environments for developers.
        Worked with the \acr{SCM} group on taking steps towards Continuous Deployment by setting up a \acr{CD} pipeline in Jenkins, and helping with deployment scripts.
        Worked very closely with \acr{QA} and other development teams, mentoring them on the Groovy language, the Spock testing framework, \acr{BDD} with Cucumber, and functional web testing with Geb and Selenium Grid; the testing stack that the company ultimately adopted.
        Worked with the \acr{DBA}s to reduce ad-hoc chaos by introducing and adopting database migration tools (Liquibase).
